## Fast_TypeScript_Compiler

Simple way to compile your all your .ts files  at once!  
No need for a tsconfig.json , just "./ftsc" in your terminal and the executable will call the ts compiler on all the .ts files in the directory !  
The output will be put in an "src_js" file.
You can clear the generated .js file by passing "--clean" as an argument !
The tsc TypeSript compiler need to be installed in order for this to work !
